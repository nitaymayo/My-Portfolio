<h1>Board Number Game</h1>

Java based android aplication I wrote in android-studio<br>

An Android game in Java using Android Studio that presents players with a scrambled board of tiles, each with a number on it. The objective of the game is to arrange the numbers in order, which is a simple yet challenging task that requires players to think strategically and use their problem-solving skills. The game provides an engaging and interactive experience, making it a great way to pass the time while exercising the brain.
